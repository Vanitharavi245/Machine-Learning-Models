Predicting House Prices in Ames, Iowa: My Approach and Insights
1. Introduction
In this project, I participated in a Kaggle-style competition focused on predicting the final sale price of homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset provided included 79 features, presenting an excellent opportunity to explore creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques. My objective was to build a model that could accurately predict house prices, while also learning and applying different machine learning techniques.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I began by conducting a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data better. This step involved:

Data Overview: I analyzed the key features, their distributions, and correlations. This helped me identify patterns and trends that could be useful for model building.
Handling Missing Values: To address missing data, I employed various imputation strategies, such as filling missing values with the median, mode, or a specific constant. I also decided to drop features with too many missing values.
Feature Engineering: I spent time creating new features, such as combining existing ones (e.g., total square footage) and transforming categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding. I also removed or modified features that didn't add value to the predictive power of the model.
3. Modeling Approaches
Random Forest Regressor
I started with the Random Forest Regressor due to its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with multiple features. My process included:

Initial Model: The initial Random Forest model gave me a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 28,457.
Hyperparameter Tuning: I then tuned the hyperparameters, such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples split. Surprisingly, the tuned model resulted in a slightly higher RMSE of 29,351, likely due to overfitting or the limitations of the selected hyperparameters.
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Recognizing the potential of Gradient Boosting, particularly for structured/tabular data, I implemented this model next:

Initial Model: The initial Gradient Boosting model performed better, with an RMSE of 28,215.
Hyperparameter Tuning: I focused on optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate, number of estimators, and maximum depth. The tuning process significantly improved the model's performance, resulting in a reduced RMSE of 25,480. This model outperformed the Random Forest and became my primary choice for further work.
Deep Learning Model
Curious about the potential of deep learning, I experimented with a neural network model:

Model Architecture: I designed a neural network with several hidden layers, ReLU activations, and dropout for regularization.
Challenges: Despite my efforts, the deep learning model produced a much higher RMSE of 187,780, indicating possible issues like overfitting or that neural networks might not be the best fit for this tabular data.
Reflection: The high RMSE suggested that deep learning might require more advanced architectures or additional data preprocessing to compete with ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting.
4. Model Comparison
After building and tuning the models, I compared their performance:

The Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the best-performing model with an RMSE of 25,480, highlighting its effectiveness for this type of dataset.
The Random Forest Regressor performed well initially but did not improve with tuning, possibly due to overfitting.
The Deep Learning Model underperformed, demonstrating the challenges of applying neural networks to structured data without further refinement.
5. Final Model and Submission
For the final submission, I chose the Gradient Boosting Regressor due to its superior performance. I used this model to generate predictions for the test dataset and created the submission file following the competition's guidelines.

6. Conclusion
This competition reinforced the importance of feature engineering and model tuning in achieving better performance. While ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting proved to be highly effective, the experience with deep learning highlighted areas for further exploration, such as trying different architectures or stacking models.

Moving forward,
