Building more accurate prediction model for house price prediction. 
Initally, i tried multiple regression model 
Then i tried polynomial regression. It shows overfitting. 
To regularise the data, I  did lasso and ridge (L1 and L2 norm) 
Eventually i compared all model and suggest best predicting model based on MSE, R square value
